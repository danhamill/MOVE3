## MOVE1

MOVE1 code reads directly from a HEC-DSS file. 

https://github.com/danhamill/MOVE3/blob/2fce4a71c0758fc276b809f313bb04b2ed53c2ae/move3/test/test.py#L39-L68

Code is tested against an [example](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/confluence/display/SSPTutorialsGuides/Daily+Flow+Record+Extension+with+MOVE.1) provided by the USACE Hydrologic Engineering Center.

## MOVE3
MOVE3 code read directly from a text file. 

Code is tested aginst an [example](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm4B5) from Appendix 8 in Bulletin 17C.

Data are read from a csv format with the following format:

| WY   | flow |
|------|------|
| 1900 | 3000 |
| 1901 | 5000 |

There should be a individual files for short and long records.  The files get merged into a single dataframe within the code. Example input is provided in `data/`

This application is designed to perform Bulletin 17C (England et al. 2019) record extension using MOVE.3 and MOVE.1 Methodologies.  

There are three possible extension using the MOVE.3:
1. Full N2 extension - This provides the longest possible short record extension.  Be careful because this type of extension has the potential to be artificially long and could result in underestimation of uncertainty of the resulting flood frequency curve.
2. ne (mean) extension - This provides extension based upon the variance of the mean.  
3. ne (variance extension) - This provides the shortest possible short record extension using the variance of variance.  This type of extension is preferable when uncertainty is primary concern.  Note: This is the preferred approach presented in Bulletin 17C
